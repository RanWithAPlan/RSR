news_event.1.t:0 "Leninist Coup In Germany"
news_event.1.d:0 "Relations between the two communist blocs have always been tense, but never as hostile as today. In a move which shocked many international observers, including in Moscow itself, the German military clique Roter Frontkämpferbund have usurped power and stormed administrative centres throughout the country, including the Volkstag, the seat of power in Berlin. Politicians were dragged from their beds in the early hours of morning and are currently under house arrest. A general strike has been called by opposition parties, to which the GKP and RFB have issued a joint statement encouraging the public to welcome the new era in Germany's history. Not everyone has welcomed this new era however, as riots and attacks on military personnel are erupting throughout the nation."
news_event.1.a:0 "Good lord"
news_event.2.t:0 "RFB Leaders Arrested"
news_event.2.d:0 "Shocking news is making its way out of Berlin today, as several leaders of the German military clique known as Roter Frontkämpferbund have been arrested under charges of treason. The German government has released documents showing that the RFB planned to overthrow the current administration and replace it with a one-party vanguard state. Some documents suggest Moscow was involved in this plot, the Soviet government has not yet made a statement. Those arrested have declard the documents fake, a view which the DKP shares, viewing the event as a calculated political ploy by KPD and USPD members. Regardless of this, tensions between the two internationals has never been higher, and the issue has drove an even deeper wedge through the international socialist movement."

news_event.3.t:0 "Lenin Dead"
news_event.3.d:0 "For over a decade, Vladimir Lenin has been leading the Soviet Union, but that state of affairs has come to an end with his inevitable death. A lavish state funeral is alreasy being planned that is expected to draw a crowd thousands strong, with socialist leaders from across the world attending. For years Lenin's health was in constant flux, suffering strokes which made him unable to lead for months at a time, the Soviet Government became more factionalised and weaker than ever. The unity of the constituent republics worsened, and the raging debate over the NEP only left the Soviet Union isolated and unstable. With Lenin's demise though, the opportunity for change arises, but who will secure power, and will they follow Lenin's vision, or chart their own path?"
news_event.3.a:0 "Rest in peace Comrade Lenin, hero of the international proletariat"
news_event.3.b:0 "We may have had our disagreements, but he will be missed"
news_event.3.c:0 "So the bastard's finally dead"
news_event.4.t:0 "Stalin Takes Power"
news_event.4.d:0 "The death of Lenin opened a power vaccum in the Soviet Union, and as the bitter factionalism that had gripped the party for years finally exploded, one man emerged victorious. Joseph Stalin has taken control of the party, and of the Soviet Union itself. He has his work cut out for him, among the issues to address are the New Economic Policy, the international isolation of the Soviet Union, and the percieved rise of nationalism in the constituent republics. Stalin's rise to power is a significant event in international politics, serving to deepen the divide with Berlin, who view him as much less tolerable than other figures such as kamenev."
news_event.4.a:0 "Congratulations Comrade Stalin"
news_event.4.b:0 "This does not bode well"
news_event.5.t:0 "Chaos In Austria"
news_event.5.d:0 "2 days ago the socialist SDAPÖ emerged victorious in the Austrian elections, a victory which ended 15 years of Christian Social Party rule. However, this victory has proven shortlived as today reactionary paramilitaries Heimwehr and Ostmärkische Sturmscharen launched a coup d'etat to take back power. Facing almost no resistance from the police or gendarmerie, the paramilitaries have delivered power to Englebert Dollfuss, who has proclaimed a state of emergency and effectively created a corporatist dictatorship. In cities across Austria, socialists, communists, and even some liberals have taken up arms against the Dollfuss government, with most of these fighters being organised into the Republikanischer Schutzbund. Death and destruction is soon to follow."
news_event.5.a:0 "Reactionary scum"
news_event.5.b:0 "They really overthrew a legitimate government like that?"
news_event.5.c:0 "Better dead than red"
news_event.6.t:0 "Christian Social Party Wins The Austrian Elections"
news_event.6.d:0 "Coming as a suprise to nobody, the Christian Social Party (Christlichsoziale Partei) has maintained their 15 year rule over Austria. Together with a coalition of smaller conservative parties, the CSP has so far prevented the socialist SDAPÖ from taking power, and that tradition is now set to continue for another 3 years. All is not well however, as reactionary, corporatist, forces continue to grow within and without the party, threatening to upturn the young democracy, only time will tell whether this endeavour succeeds."
news_event.6.a:0 "Nothing more than puppets for the wealthy"
news_event.6.b:0 "Congratulations"
news_event.7.t:0 "Socialist Parties Banned In Austria"
news_event.7.d:0 "After consolidating power in the recent election, Englebert Dollfuss, chancellor of Austria, and member of the Christian Social Party, has achieved almost complete control of Austria. Less than two days ago, Dollfuss pushed through a decree banning all socialist parties, while members of the SDAPÖ were barred from entering the parliament by the reactionary paramilitary known as the Heimwehr. Already, police raids have provoked armed resistance and uprisings against the Dollfuss government, and the SDAPÖ has called for its members to take up arms, utilising the illegal paramilitary force known as the Republikanischer Schutzbund. Smaller socialist parties such as the KAPÖ and KPÖ have also echoed the call for armed resistance. This could be a fight for the fate of Austria"
news_event.7.a:0 "Such blatant infringements on democracy should not be tolerated"
news_event.7.b:0 "Such actions are necessary when faced with the red menace"
news_event.8.t:0 "Germany Invades Austria"
news_event.8.d:0 "In the latest escalation of the so called Austria Crisis (as it has been dubbed by international spectators), a joint Italo-German force has intervened and invaded Austria. The leaders of the German and Italian governments, [GER.GetLeader] and [ITA.GetLeader], made a dual-statement a few hours after the beginning of the invasion; citing overlapping territorial claims, national security, the illegitimacy of the Austrian government, and the need to restore peace in Austria. Almost all international spectators expect Austria to fall within days, due to the superior numbers, organisation, and technology of the Italo-German forces compared to the much smaller, unprepared, Austrian force which lacks modern military essentials such as armoured vehicles and a significant air presence."
news_event.8.a:0 "The international proletariat knows no borders"
news_event.8.b:0 "This is an illegal invasion!"
news_event.9.t:0 "Germany and Austria unite"
news_event.9.d:0 "Following the Austria Crisis and the defeat of nationalist forces in Austria, a socialist government was installed in Vienna with the support of Workintern military might. This new government didn't last long however as today [AUS.GetLeader] and [GER.GetLeader] signed the Karl-Marx-Hof Treaty in the iconic residential building that was previously the centre of the Vienna Soviet. The treaty stipulated that [AUS.GetNameDef] will cease to exist as an independent entity, instead being incorporated into a political union with [GER.GetName], this has already caused massive international uproar as it is in violation of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and as such France has refused to recognise Austria as a part of Germany."
