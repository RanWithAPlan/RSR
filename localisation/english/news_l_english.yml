news_event.1.d:0 "Relations between the two communist blocs have always been tense, but never as hostile as today. In a move which shocked many international observers, including in Moscow itself, the German military clique Roter Frontkämpferbund have usurped power and stormed administrative centres throughout the country, including the Volkstag, the seat of power in Berlin. Politicians were dragged from their beds in the early hours of morning and are currently under house arrest. A general strike has been called by opposition parties, to which the GKP and RFB have issued a joint statement encouraging the public to welcome the new era in Germany's history. Not everyone has welcomed this new era however, as riots and attacks on military personnel are erupting throughout the nation."

news_event.2.d:0 "Shocking news is making its way out of Berlin today, as several leaders of the German military clique known as Roter Frontkämpferbund have been arrested under charges of treason. The German government has released documents showing that the RFB planned to overthrow the current administration and replace it with a one-party vanguard state. Some documents suggest Moscow was involved in this plot, the Soviet government has not yet made a statement. Those arrested have declard the documents fake, a view which the DKP shares, viewing the event as a calculated political ploy by KPD and USPD members. Regardless of this, tensions between the two internationals has never been higher, and the issue has drove an even deeper wedge through the international socialist movement."
