 sports.1.d:0 "The 1936 Summer Olympics, hosted in Barcelona, Spain, have been concluded. Attended by athletes from 47 different nations worldwide, Barcelona 1936 was the first Olympiad in history to have enjoyed limited live television coverage. American athletes saw the most success, winning 29 gold medals, four of these being won by Jesse Owens, the single most successful athlete of the Games. The runners-up were Germany, with 23 medals won.\n\nThe games were also marked by the everlasting absence of an Italian team, thanks to the grey area that has become the existence of an Italian state since the 1920 events. Other teams missing for similar reasons are all the Baltic States and Portugal, declared “too unstable” to participate."
