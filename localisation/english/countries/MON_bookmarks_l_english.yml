 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Independent from China, the Great Mongolian State existed under the rule of Bogd Khan until 1919 when China decided to send their troops to yet again deprive Mongolian nation of their freedom. In 1920, Bogh Khan along with his wife Tsendiin Dondogdulam were assassinated by a group of Tuvan-Mongol collaborators, announcing the birth of Uriankhai Marxist Union. Genepil, ex queen consort of Bogd Khan led the nation in this time of trial. The “Second Mongol Independence War” continued until 1936 when the Royal Government of Mongolia ultimately managed to push Chinese and Uriankhai forces away from their land. \n\nFor her bravery and commitment, Genepil was chosen as the first female Khan in Mongolian history. Now, torn apart after years of devastating conflict, Mongolia and its people have to not only rebuild their nation, but also find their place in the world, once again threatened by a looming shadow of another Great War."
 MON_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After years of hard work, abnegations and struggle, Great Mongolian Khanate has finally become a respected power in Asia, slowly rebuilding the pride its ancestors and the glory of Genghis Khan. Getting rid of communist scheme plaguing the country and once and for all braking the Chinese yoke, Mongolia undeniably consolidated it's existence and power.\n\nNevertheless, the dark clouds are covering the entire world, foreshadowing the arrival of another terrible challenge for the mankind. The growing greed of the big, red, socialist neighbour, increasing Japanese expansionism as well as unpredictable nature of Chinese rules are only some of the many threats surrounding the Mongolian nation. Will the descendants of almighty Huns be able to deal with all the adversities awaiting them?"
