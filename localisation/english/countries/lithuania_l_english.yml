 lithuania.1.title:0 "Socialist Revolution in Lithuania"
 lithuania.1.desc:0 "Shocking news has come out of Lithuania today of an uprising against the dictatorship under Smetona. This rebbelion began early in the morning when members of the Lithuanian Communist Party a once Leninist party now a Germany backed Council Communist organization delared the Lithuanian Condederation. This declaration was quickly followed by various militias and paramilitaries seizing key cities in the West and South and after a several hour stuggle the capital of Vilnius. Although the revolution hoped to claim the whole nation this didn't happen and Smetona and loyal members of the military have retreated north to prepare to take the country back. It seems now that civil war is inevitable and the once peaceful nation of Lithuania will be just another European nation embroiled in the fight between nationalism and socialism."

 lithuania.2.title:0 "Civil War!"
 lithuania.2.desc:0 "Just 10 days ago the LKP and its allies rose in revolution against the mighty Lithuanian nation and since then our soldiers have simply been looking nerviouslly across the border, but no longer as the socialist armied have finally come for a fight. Now as the German backed red army marches farther into Lithuania we must make a stand and protect the mighty rights of property and authority and hope that the Poles will take pity on our cause and join in our crusade against Socialism."

 lithuania.3.title:0 "Socialist Victory in Lithuanian Civil War"
 lithuania.3.desc:0 "News has come from Vilnius that the guns of Lithuania have finally gone quite and the civil war has ended with the defeat of Smetona's government. With Smetona's defeat and the fall of the old Lithuanian order the Council Communists in the LKP and the Revolutionary Council now reign supreme in Lithuania with their entry into the 4th Internationale now being almost a gaurentee. Although Smetona's defeat could have been predicted, Germany now lies with yet another ally and the nationalists now have yet another enemy."
