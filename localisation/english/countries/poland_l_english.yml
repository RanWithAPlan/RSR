 natpoland.1.title:0 "The National Congress of 1936"
 natpoland.1.desc:0 "The power in Poland is split between two groups, Roman Dmowski, and the National Congress, and every year the congress convenes with Dmowski for a general meeting of the nation. This division however runs deep, even in the congress, as Dmowski and his supporters try every trick they know to win over supporters of the members of the congress. This trickery however isn't unique to Dmowski, and his opposition in the congress know it just as well, and the opposition deemed the 1936 congress to be the time to strike against Dmowski. This plot took the face of bombing the congress when Dmowski and his supporters are all in one room together, but it's success is risky, and Dmowski could discover it at any time."

 natpoland.5.desc:0 "What started as a dream by Dmowski has now been realized, the dream of a truly Catholic Poland. Step by step Dmowski has been taking rights away from non-Catholics, and by doing so forcing them to convert, and with the church working hand in hand with Dmowski's government it led to an uptake in support for Dmowski. This however is only one step towards the complete purification of Poland, as while the people may be Catholic, not all Catholics are Falangists, and not all Falangists are true soldiers in the struggle for complete supremacy for Polish Nationalism."

 natpoland.6.title:0 "National Congress Abolished"
 natpoland.6.desc:0 "Ever since the National Republic was established there has been only one thing stopping Dmowski from creating a full dictatorship, that being the National Congress. Created by the ONR-Falanga, the congress acted as a counter weight to Dmowski, but when the traitors in the congress atempted to take Dmowski's life a state of emergency was declared and the congress was suspeneded. However being suspended didn't mean that the congress was abolished, and after the slow decrease in congress abilities, and popularity by the hands of Dmowski, it has finally come the time to do away with the traitors. In a speech given by Dmowski he declared that now with the traitors dealt with, through Dmowski Polish Nationalism can truly flourish, and he shall once more bring purity to Poland, and make it into the true Natioanlist, Catholic and Individualist nation it was meant to be. Although it seems that Dmowski's dictatorship has been fully realized, there could still be those unloyal in our ranks, and they must be dealt with."

 POL_divided_government_desc:0 "Although the ONR-Falanga has cemented its power of Poland, it is divided. This divide stems from the differences between the so called 'Father of Poland', Roman Dmowski, and the National Congress which counter acts Dmowski. Although the Congress was set up by Dmowski to provide legitimacy and stability to his government it has since become filled with enemies to his regime which are just waiting for the time to strike. Should this divide not be mended, by force if neccesary then it is certain to tear Poland apart."

Although the armies of the red flags marched from Germany and Russia towards Warsaw the mighty Polish nation resisted. And that spirit of resistance against Socialism, Bolshevism, and Anarchism has stayed true under the watchful eye of the ONR-Falanga. And when the socialists come marching against Poland again, Poland will be there to defend, and through the spirit of nationalism it will drive the socialists back to Berlin and Kyiv and bring about a brown tide of nationalism across Europe!"
