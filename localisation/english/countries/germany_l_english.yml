 socgermany.1.t:0 "The January Elections"
 socgermany.1.d:0 "This month, people all across the country will be voting for delegates and council members. The Anarchisten, Dezentralisten, and Zentralisten, will all be competing for power, all with different ideas on how the nation should be run. Will the Dezentralisten maintain control, with their moderate policies, or will the Anarchisten, or Zentralisten snatch power from them?"
 socgermany.1.a:0 "Let the elections begin!"
 socgermany.2.t:0 "The Zentralisten Speech"
 socgermany.2.d:0 "Ruth Fischer, a prominent Zentralisten member and feminist, has given a rousing speech in support of the Zentalisten. To a crowd of over 10,000, Fischer passionately spoke of the need for centralisation and state influence in the economy. She talked of how the syndicates needed to be subjected to state influence, and also of the creation of a chancellor, who would make quick decisions that would stop some of the deadlock of the executive council."
 socgermany.2.a:0 "She makes a strong case"
 socgermany.3.t:0 "The Dezantralisten Speech"
 socgermany.3.d:0 "Heinrich Brandler, who is representing the Dezentralisten, gave a passionate speech today in Berlin, and a huge crowd flocked to hear him. He talked about the councils, the system the republic was founded on, and the importance of their continued power. If the republic was to survive, the councils must be empowered, and the syndicates should take a backseat to local, small scale plans, although the syndicates were still an important institution."
 socgermany.3.a:0 "A great speech"
 socgermany.4.t:0 "The Anarchisten Speech"
 socgermany.4.d:0 "Rudolf Rocker gave a speech today in Essen, one of the Anarchisten strongholds, to a crowd that filled the streets to hear him. Rocker, spoke strongly of the need for reduced state control, the deconstruction of social hierarchies, and all coercive hierarchy. He then went on to discuss the syndicates, and the importance of their independence. Free association and horizontial organisation was, he argued, part of the bedrock of German society."
 socgermany.4.a:0 "He makes good points"
 socgermany.5.t:0 "And The Winner Is..."
 socgermany.5.d:0 "The results are in, the votes have been counted, and the party with the majority of seats is..."
 socgermany.5.a:0 "Anarchisten!"
 socgermany.5.b:0 "Dezentralisten!"
 socgermany.5.c:0 "Zentralisten!"
 socgermany.6.t:0 "Economic Syndicate Debate - Annual Production Plan"
 socgermany.6.d:0 "The parties have put forward their plan for the year, the Anarchisten, strongly in support of anti-militarism, have proposed a decentralised model, and the conversion of military industry to suit civilian needs. The Dezentralisten also support a decentralised economy, and place an emphasis on industrialising the countryside. The Zentralisten, splitting from the decentralised economics of the other two parties, have focused on strengthening the urban centres of Germany and continuing military build up."
 socgermany.6.a:0 "The Anarchisten plan is the best course of action."
 socgermany.6.b:0 "The Dezentralisten plan will lead the economy in the right direction."
 socgermany.6.c:0 "The Dezentralisten plan is a good idea for the economy."
