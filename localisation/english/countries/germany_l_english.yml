 socgermany.1.t:0 "The January Elections Approach"
 socgermany.1.d:0 "This month, people all across the country will be voting for delegates and council members. The FAUD, KPD, and USPD, will all be competing for power, all with different ideas on how the nation should be run. Will the KPD maintain control, with their moderate policies, or will the FAUD, or USPD snatch power from them?"
 socgermany.1.a:0 "Let the elections begin!"
 socgermany.2.t:0 "The USPD Speech"
 socgermany.2.d:0 "Ruth Fischer, a prominent USPD member and feminist, has given a rousing speech in support of the Zentalisten. To a crowd of over 10,000, Fischer passionately spoke of the need for centralisation and state influence in the economy. She talked of how the syndicates needed to be subjected to state influence, and also of the creation of a chancellor, who would make quick decisions that would stop some of the deadlock of the executive council."
 socgermany.2.a:0 "She makes a strong case"
 socgermany.3.t:0 "The Dezantralisten Speech"
 socgermany.3.d:0 "Heinrich Brandler, who is representing the KPD, gave a passionate speech today in Berlin, and a huge crowd flocked to hear him. He talked about the councils, the system the republic was founded on, and the importance of their continued power. If the republic was to survive, the councils must be empowered, and the syndicates should take a backseat to local, small-scale plans, although the syndicates were still an important institution."
 socgermany.3.a:0 "A great speech"
 socgermany.4.t:0 "The FAUD Speech"
 socgermany.4.d:0 "Rudolf Rocker gave a speech today in Essen, one of the FAUD strongholds, to a crowd that filled the streets to hear him. Rocker spoke strongly of the need for reduced state control, the deconstruction of social hierarchies, and all coercive hierarchy. He then went on to discuss the syndicates, and the importance of their independence. Free association and horizontal organisation was, he argued, part of the bedrock of German society."
 socgermany.4.a:0 "He makes good points"
 socgermany.5.t:0 "And The Winner Is..."
 socgermany.5.d:0 "The results are in, the votes have been counted, and the party with the majority of seats is..."
 socgermany.5.a:0 "FAUD!"
 socgermany.5.b:0 "KPD!"
 socgermany.5.c:0 "USPD!"
 socgermany.6.t:0 "Economic Syndicate Debate - Annual Production Plan"
 socgermany.6.d:0 "The parties have put forward their plan for the year, the FAUD, strongly in support of anti-militarism, have proposed a decentralised model, and the conversion of military industry to suit civilian needs. The KPD also support a decentralised economy, and place an emphasis on industrialising the countryside. The USPD, splitting from the decentralised economics of the other two parties, have focused on strengthening the urban centres of Germany and continuing military build up."
 socgermany.6.a:0 "The FAUD plan is the best course of action."
 socgermany.6.b:0 "The KPD plan will lead the economy in the right direction."
 socgermany.6.c:0 "The USPD plan is a good idea for the economy."
 socgermany.7.t:0 "Economic Syndicate Debate - Industrial Specialization"
 socgermany.7.d:0 "A large amount of factories are scheduled to be upgraded with the latest tools. However, there is a debate in the syndicates as to how this should be done. The USPD have prioritised the cities to recieve the new equipment. However, the KPD and FAUD have both expressed support to distribute it based on need, rather than net benefit."
 socgermany.7.a:0 "The KPD and FAUD win the debate"
 socgermany.7.b:0 "The USPD make a suprise victory"#
