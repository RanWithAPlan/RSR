 socgermany.1.t:0 "The January Elections Approach"
 socgermany.1.d:0 "This month, people all across the country will be voting for delegates and council members. The FAUD, KPD, and USPD, will all be competing for power, all with different ideas on how the nation should be run. Will the KPD maintain control, with their moderate policies, or will the FAUD, or USPD snatch power from them?"
 socgermany.1.a:0 "Let the elections begin!"
 socgermany.2.t:0 "The USPD Speech"
 socgermany.2.d:0 "Ruth Fischer, a prominent USPD member and feminist, has given a rousing speech in support of the Zentalisten. To a crowd of over 10,000, Fischer passionately spoke of the need for centralisation and state influence in the economy. She talked of how the syndicates needed to be subjected to state influence, and also of the creation of a chancellor, who would make quick decisions that would stop some of the deadlock of the executive council."
 socgermany.2.a:0 "She makes a strong case"
 socgermany.3.t:0 "The Dezantralisten Speech"
 socgermany.3.d:0 "Heinrich Brandler, who is representing the KPD, gave a passionate speech today in Berlin, and a huge crowd flocked to hear him. He talked about the councils, the system the republic was founded on, and the importance of their continued power. If the republic was to survive, the councils must be empowered, and the syndicates should take a backseat to local, small-scale plans, although the syndicates were still an important institution."
 socgermany.3.a:0 "A great speech"
 socgermany.4.t:0 "The FAUD Speech"
 socgermany.4.d:0 "Rudolf Rocker gave a speech today in Essen, one of the FAUD strongholds, to a crowd that filled the streets to hear him. Rocker spoke strongly of the need for reduced state control, the deconstruction of social hierarchies, and all coercive hierarchy. He then went on to discuss the syndicates, and the importance of their independence. Free association and horizontal organisation was, he argued, part of the bedrock of German society."
 socgermany.4.a:0 "He makes good points"
 socgermany.5.t:0 "And The Winner Is..."
 socgermany.5.d:0 "The results are in, the votes have been counted, and the party with the majority of seats is..."
 socgermany.5.a:0 "FAUD!"
 socgermany.5.b:0 "KPD!"
 socgermany.5.c:0 "USPD!"
 socgermany.6.t:0 "Economic Syndicate Debate - Annual Production Plan"
 socgermany.6.d:0 "The parties have put forward their plan for the year, the FAUD, strongly in support of anti-militarism, have proposed a decentralised model, and the conversion of military industry to suit civilian needs. The KPD also support a decentralised economy, and place an emphasis on industrialising the countryside. The USPD, splitting from the decentralised economics of the other two parties, have focused on strengthening the urban centres of Germany and continuing military build up."
 socgermany.6.a:0 "The FAUD plan is the best course of action."
 socgermany.6.b:0 "The KPD plan will lead the economy in the right direction."
 socgermany.6.c:0 "The USPD plan is a good idea for the economy."
 socgermany.7.t:0 "Economic Syndicate Debate - Industrial Specialization"
 socgermany.7.d:0 "A large amount of factories are scheduled to be upgraded with the latest tools. However, there is a debate in the syndicates as to how this should be done. The USPD have prioritised the cities to recieve the new equipment. However, the KPD and FAUD have both expressed support to distribute it based on need, rather than net benefit."
 socgermany.7.a:0 "The KPD win the debate"
 socgermany.7.b:0 "The USPD make a suprise victory"
 socgermany.9.t:0 "Crushing Revisionism"
 socgermany.9.d:0 "All the pieces were in place, after months of careful preparation, they were now ready to strike at the heart of 'left-communist' revisionism. Thälmann's loyal troops has assembled before him, and now waited patiently for him to give the order, he checked his watch. "My comrades" Thälmann shouted, "the time has come to save the German people from the clutches of so called left communism. Today, we will complete the revolution and banish the infantile disorder from birthplace of Marx and Engels!" The soldiers cheered.\n\nThe first rays of light had begun to shine through the darkness. Thälmann checked his watch again, 10 minutes to 5, he gave the order, and his brave soldiers began marching into the street. It was early, almost nobody would be awake, his soldiers, guided by the street lights and the spirit of revolution, continued marching. The inky black had begun to give away to day, Thälmann again checked his watch. The big hand struck 5 O'clock, and as the morning sun slowly crept over the sky, politicians woke up to find men in uniform standing over them, in a few cases they heard gunshots, guards fighting with the intruders. In a few hours, the coup was complete. By now the sun had risen, and with it a new Germany, Ernst Thälmann smiled.\n\n§RNote From Developers: As there is currently no content for the coup path, this is considered a fail state, we hope to add content at some point in the future however."
 socgermany.9.a:0 "We Are Unstoppable!"
 socgermany.10.t:0 "Third Internationalist Plot Thwarted"
 socgermany.10.d:0 "For months we have been playing a dangerous game with the RFB, while our spies infiltrated their traitorous circles, and attacked from within, we have worked tirelessly to curtail the power of the rogue clique from outside. A fresh crop of loyal generals, and some... encouragement towards some old ones has meant that the Roter Frontkämpferbund is now weaker than ever. We now have all the evidence we need and the strength to use it, it's time to behead the serpent.\n\nThälmann was woken up by his wife. 'Ernst' she whispered 'I heard something downstairs', he waited for his eyes to adjust to the light, or rather the absence of it. 'Jesus Rosa, what time is it?' he yawned and rubbed his eyes, 'It's 2 hours after midnight my love', came the reply. Ernst stretched and climbed out of bed, clumsily using his hands to feel the space around him, he reached his nightstand and grabbed a lamp. The brightness took the couple a few seconds to adjust to, but they made their way to the door, it was then that Ernst hesitated, and looked back at his bed, he swiftly grabbed the pistol from under his pillow. 'Follow me' he whispered.\n\nHolding the gun infront of him, Thälmann cautiously opened the door, and quickly checked the hallway, nothing there. It was then that they heard footsteps downstairs, 'What could the intruder possibly want?' Rosa furrowed her brow. Ernst was now fearing the worst, and where the hell were the guards? Ernst motioned for Rosa to follow him, and, after putting out the lamp, the couple began the procession down the stairs. Thälmann aimed his pistol into the darkness, holding his breath at every step. He winced as the last stair creeked, and when the footsteps came closer and closer, he and Rosa felt a blanket of dread suffocate them. Aiming his psitol with a shaky hand, Thälmann prepared to take down the intruder.\n\nIt was over in an instant, Thälmann fired two shots and heard a grunt as the agent he shot fell to the floor, clutching his leg. But it wasnt enough, another agent barreled into him, and he found himself pinned to the ground while his wife screamed. The gun fell out of his hands and clattered across the floor."
 socgermany.10.a:0 "'Mr. Thälmann, you are under arrest.'"
 flavour_germany.1.t:0 "The Wisent Breeding Program"
 flavour_germany.1.d:0 "In the Great War, occupying German troops hunted the last European bison (or Wisent) herd in the Białowieża Forest, killing over 98% of the herd (600 bison). In 1923 The International Society for the Preservation of the Wisent was formed, the last wild bison in Poland had been killed 2 years earlier and in 1927 the last Caucasian Wisent was killed and the animal became extinct in the wild. Acquirring animals from many different zoos, The International Society for the Preservation of the Wisent has made steady progress in bringing the species back from the brink, following the model of the American Bison Society. The society is hoping for planning permission and extra-resources to expand their project and facilities, as well as creating a reserve for them in Germany, as Białowieża Forest was considered too politically unsafe."
 flavour_germany.1.a:0 "We'll gladly support this endeavour!"
