 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Independent from China, the Great Mongolian State existed under the rule of Bogd Khan until 1919 when China decided to send their troops to yet again deprive Mongolian nation of their freedom. In 1920, Bogh Khan along with his wife Tsendiin Dondogdulam were assassinated by a group of Tuvan-Mongol collaborators, announcing the birth of Uriankhai Marxist Union. Genepil, ex queen consort of Bogd Khan led the nation in this time of trial. The “Second Mongol Independence War” continued until 1936 when the Royal Government of Mongolia ultimately managed to push Chinese and Uriankhai forces away from their land. \n\nFor her bravery and commitment, Genepil was chosen as the first female Khan in Mongolian history. Now, torn apart after years of devastating conflict, Mongolia and its people have to not only rebuild their nation, but also find their place in the world, once again threatened by a looming shadow of another Great War."
